🏠 House Price Prediction - A machine learning project developed during my internship at ShulaTech Solutions. Designed to predict housing prices based on key features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and property condition. Built using Python, Scikit-learn, and data analysis tools to provide accurate and reliable price estimates.
